Next.js Specific Polyfills</p>
<p>AsyncLocalStorage</p>
<p>Environment Variables</p>
<p>You can use process.env to access Environment Variables for both next dev and next build.
Unsupported APIs</p>
<p>The Edge Runtime has some restrictions including:</p>
<p>Native Node.js APIs are not supported. For example, you can't read or write to the filesystem.
node_modules can be used, as long as they implement ES Modules and do not use native Node.js APIs.
Calling require directly is not allowed. Use ES Modules instead.</p>
<p>The following JavaScript language features are disabled, and will not work:
APIDescriptionevalEvaluates JavaScript code represented as a stringnew Function(evalString)Creates a new function with the code provided as an argumentWebAssembly.compileCompiles a WebAssembly module from a buffer sourceWebAssembly.instantiateCompiles and instantiates a WebAssembly module from a buffer source
In rare cases, your code could contain (or import) some dynamic code evaluation statements which can not be reached at runtime and which can not be removed by treeshaking.
You can relax the check to allow specific files with your Middleware configuration:
middleware.tsexport const config = {
unstable_allowDynamic: [
// allows a single file
'/lib/utilities.js',
// use a glob to allow anything in the function-bind 3rd party module
'<strong>/node_modules/function-bind/</strong>',
],
}
unstable_allowDynamic is a glob, or an array of globs, ignoring dynamic code evaluation for specific files. The globs are relative to your application root folder.
Be warned that if these statements are executed on the Edge, they will throw and cause a runtime error.Was this helpful?</p>
